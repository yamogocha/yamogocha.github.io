                    You’ll receive the dedicated attention of an expert team that respects you, truly listens, and
                    understands
                    what it takes to win you the best possible settlement. Unlike the larger firms, we treat each client
                    like
                    family and care deeply about getting you what you deserve – so you can heal and move forward with

                        <span class="italic">accident</span> can turn your life upside down in a heartbeat. The truth
                        is, insurance companies want to pay as

                            lawyer in your corner is essential to protect you and ensure you receive the highest

                    As a prospective client, you will be connected immediately with founder and trial attorney Gregory
                    O’Connell
                    who will give you real-time advice and feedback about your case. Larger firms can make it difficult
                    for
                    clients to speak with their own attorney even unfavorably prioritizing clients – and their needs.
                    Effective
                    communication is the cornerstone of a successful attorney-client relationship and Mr. O’Connell
                    strives to
                    make himself available day and night to appropriately engage with each client and ensure their

            </div>
            <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">Greg O’Connell is a relentless advocate for justice. Greg combines superior
                trial and
                courtroom skills with compassionate interpersonal skills to help injured individuals and families of
                loved ones
                catastrophically injured or killed by someone else's negligence. He has more than 15 years of experience
                litigating high-stakes cases in the trial courts throughout the state.</p>
            <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">Greg began his legal career as a trial attorney at the Alameda County District
                Attorney’s Office where he prosecuted serious felonies, including murder, robbery, and sexual assault.
                In just 8
                years he obtained verdicts in 35 jury trials and 23 bench trials. He has logged thousands of litigation
                hours in
                the courtroom. During his tenure as a prosecutor, he honed courtroom-proven trial skills, poise, and
                knowledge
                of the law. Greg is not afraid to take a case to trial in order to obtain a successful outcome for a
                client.</p>
            <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">After leaving the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, Greg applied his
                prosecutorial talents to plaintiff’s side personal<span>practice because he wanted to help people more
                    directly. Greg worked for the legendary Dolan Law Firm and litigation-powerhouse Rains Lucia Stern
                    St. Phalle &
                    Silver, PC, where he made a name for himself as an aggressive and compassionate trial attorney,
                    securing
                    multi-million-dollar settlements and verdicts for clients.</p>
            <p class="text-[16px] pb-8">Greg has now brought his extensive knowledge and experience to GOC Legal, P.C.,
                which
                he founded in 2020 with the purpose of expertly representing individuals around the Bay Area who have
                been
                injured and seek full and fair justice in the courts. He excels in all areas of litigation, from
                pre-trial case
                investigation, pre-litigation settlement offers and case strategy, to fact discovery, expert witness
                examination, motion practice, trial preparation, mediation, and settlement – and especially jury trial.
                Greg’s
                courtroom skills allow him to connect with juries to achieve significant verdicts for his personal <span
                    class="italic">injury</span>
                clients. Greg is an accomplished litigator in a variety of areas including auto <span
                    class="italic">accidents</span>, auto vs. pedestrian
                <span class="italic">accidents</span>, premises liability, contract disputes, professional malpractice,
                trucking, and wrongful death.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[16px]">Greg is a Bay Area native and resides in Oakland with his wife and dog. He grew up in
                Alameda, is an alumnus of UCLA and earned his law degree from Golden Gate University in San Francisco.
                He is an
                active member of Consumer Attorneys of California and the San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association. When
                he is
                not working passionately on behalf of his clients, he enjoys home improvement projects, traveling with
                his wife,
                discovering new local restaurants, and being a proud supporter of Dub Nation and the 49ers Faithful.</p>
